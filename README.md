<h1>üêæ Blitz Steps</h1>

This repository is a **step-by-step guide** of all the CLI commands run and files changed to manually create a simple [Blitz](https://blitzjs.com/) app from scratch. It makes it easy to reproduce the app from a fresh empty repository **without using any bit of brain**, and **as fast as possible**. Just follow-along by copy-pasting and your app will be ready in no time.

**This is not a tutorial**. It is not meant to be pedagogical and does not teach you how to use Blitz. However, people who don't like to read the docs and instantly jump to copy-pasting commands (_like me_) might find it efficient to get a fast but superficial glimpse of its concepts.

## What are we building?

We are going to build a simple app where users can sign up to create, edit, delete, and share simple notes. It's basically a full-featured minimal app to use as a reference when building other apps. We'll call it **NotesApp**.

## Why not making a boilerplate instead?

Following a step-by-step guide is more work than cloning a boilerplate but:

- You understand what's included better, because you add things as you go.
- It is better-suited for Blitz, which uses CLI commands such as Prisma migrations or model scaffolding.
- It is more flexible, since you can directly adapt commands to your project's needs.
- It is more future-proof. If libraries have breaking changes, the steps might still work fine.

Let's get started!
